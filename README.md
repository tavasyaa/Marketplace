# Marketplace
Mostly used this project to mess around with React and MySQL -- probably not going to work on it anymore!

This project was inspired by my friend wanting to sell things online. 

I'm creating a website on which one can buy or sell shoes (or anything else, really). I'm starting by building out the front-end, and then will integrate a payment system, and check products from a backend database.

To do: 
- Make jQuery button fix to the bottom of jumbotron on the homepage
- Images from AWS
- Fix Navbar, hamburger doesn't work
- The rest of the website! :)
