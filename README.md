This project was inspired by my friend wanting to sell things online. 

I'm creating a website on which one can buy or sell shoes (or anything else, really). I'm starting by building out the front-end, and then will integrate a payment system, and check products from a backend database.

Reqs, design, and development is all by me, and will change over the next few weeks.

To do: 
- Pretty much everything for now :)
